## How to improve anti-botting:

Sometimes, just an antibot is not enough... Here are ways to prevent bots from joining your games to the best of your ability

* **Enable Friendly Names** - This limits what names can be used, making the antibot more powerful
* **Enable 2FA** - Some bots try to brute force this. The Antibot detects this and can block them.
* **Enable Team Mode** - While team mode no longer prevents most bots from joining, it can help filter out some bots that use the same patters for teams. Some bots may still not support team mode, so this will help.

---

## Features planned:
* More Blocking Options (When new botting patterns are found).
* Prevent answers during team talk

## Support for other play.kahoot.it scripts

KAntibot v4 works alongside other kahoot scripts normally, meaning you do not have to add your code to an array.

* You can check if the antibot version is 4+ using `window.kantibotVersion` variable.
* Scripts using `window.antibotAdditionalScripts` will be executed by the antibot, but it is deprecated.
* The `window.antibotAdditionalReplacements` feature is no longer supported, as KAntibot does not directly patch the JS code.

To detect if the antibot is active, you can check for the `window.kantibotEnabled` variable (v3.0.0+)

### Retrieving Kahoot Internals

If you would like to make scripts that access various internals without interfering with KAntibot, you can use methods such as `window.kantibotAddHook`.

* Hooks are made of 3 parts:
  * A property name
  * A filter
  * A callback
* The hook listens for when certain properties of any object is set to something
* The filter is a function that takes the value of the property and returns true if the callback should be called
* The callback is called when the filter returns true, and is passed the value of the property, which can be used however the developer requires.
  * If it returns true, the hook will be removed after completion, otherwise it will remain active.

**Example:**

```js
window.kantibotAddHook({
  prop: "example",
  condition: function(target, value) {
    return value === "test";
  },
  callback: function(target, value) {
    console.log("The object the property is put on is", target);
    console.log("The example property is set to", value);
    return true;
  }
});
```
